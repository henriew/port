		<h1>Gentle Hands</h1>
		<p>
		I sit on the very edge of everything I know,<br>
		In a silent rapture I gaze upon the unknown,<br>
		Watching in wonder as graceful blue hands carry vessels into a vast arena of adventure.<br>
		I deem myself ready for this arena knowing you are by my side.<br>
		Your soothing voice sends waves of warmth throughout my body,<br>
		Two words forever echoing inside me,<br>
		"My Guy."<br>
		I look up into the face of my grandpa,<br>
		A true masterpiece of the heavens,<br>
		Aged to perfection,<br>
		As you guide us upon our odyssey.<br>
		And as the sun sets on this magnificent day,<br>
		We return with many trophies to showcase our adventure.<br>
		But the greatest trophy of all, has been silently tucked away in my mind.<br>
		Today both a tear and a smile adorn my face,<br>
		As gentle hands carry you out onto an eternal adventure,<br>
		Leaving behind an everlasting volume of memories,<br>
		And a warm love that burns bright,<br>
		Like an undying star.<br>
		I turn and walk away in happiness,<br>
		Knowing that my future adventures shall be guided by the most loving and gentle hands of all,<br>
		Yours.<br><br>
