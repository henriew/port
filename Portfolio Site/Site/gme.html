		<h1>Soft Words</h1>
		<p>
		Sweetest lady smiling bright<br>
		A constant wisdom leading me through life<br>
		With soft words and a shining smile<br>
		She helped bring me up to be kind and polite<br>
		No matter how far I would stray or trouble start<br>
		She always loved me with all her heart<br>
		I'll miss her deeply forever more<br>
		Sail on sweet grandma, fly through the stars<br><br>
