		<h1>Cobblestone Streets</h1>
		<p>
		As my Grandpa and I walked through the empty cobblestone streets of Greece,<br>
		I heard dust fluttering in the wind.<br>
		I realized how special this moment was.<br>
		I started to take into deep thought about the ways my Grandpa is so special.<br>
		I recognized the soft pitter-patter of his feet.<br>
		I heard the little thumps of his cane tapping the ground,<br>
		Securely held in his wrinkled hand.<br>
		I saw his eyes aged wisdom, peering through his glasses down the street.<br>
		His joyful smile, as recognizable as a crease in a piece of paper.<br>
		His smile shining down on me like a beam of light.<br>
		The wind from the beach blew gently through his gray hair.<br>
		We soon were walking by the beach, isolated by the town.<br>
		My Grandpa and I enjoyed this precious moment,<br>
		In the sight of the setting sun,<br>
		And in the sound of the waves lapping up the golden sand.<br><br>
