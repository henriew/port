		Poetry has been important to me as both an enjoyment and a medium of creativity. My biggest inspration has always been my grandfather. The first poem is one I wrote after a trip to Greece with my family in 1998. Out of all my trips this one is most dear to me, as we took my grandfather. The entire trip we were roommates, having a grand time using translation guides to have silly conversations, and walking around grecian towns together. I wrote this poem upon returning from the trip in tribute to the greatest man i've ever known.<br><br>

		In 2005 my grandpa past away.  Since he was always the biggest fan of my poems I felt it fitting that he inspire one more. The aquatic theme comes from all our time on his fishing boat.

		Before my grandmother passed in 2011, she asked that I write a poem for her service. Being the oldschool lady that she was, she made a point to request that it not be too long less it come off as vain. Further, she requested that it rhymed a bit so as to have a bit of levity, as in her words "I've lived a long full life and you should remember the happiness in that, not the sadness of it ending."
