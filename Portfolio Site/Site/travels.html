		<p>Traveling outside of the US is an experience that shapes me as a person.
		I feel that it is extremely important for people to travel if possible, as it gives you a stark reminder
		that you are just one little piece of a vast world.  Traveling has helped humble me and open
		me to different ways of thinking that have been integral to my development as a person.

		<h1><em>Northern Ireland Resistance Murals</em></h1>
		<p>
		Arriving in the Northerin Irish town of Derry was one of the most powerful experiences in my life.
		Derry was where the Irish <i>Troubles</i> started in the 70s.  The murals represent both those who died in the struggles and the harsh conditions people lived under.</p>
