		To graduate with a math degree at Kenyon, students had to pass a comprehension review consisting of both a test and a paper. I feel this paper is the best way to sum up me as a math student as it represents my favorite type of problem. I really loved problems that appear simple at first, but the more you worked on it, the more complex the equation becomes.  After many hours of furious work, you finally arrive at the answer, dazed and satisfied. The theme of my paper centers around solving for the generic nth term of a second order recurance relation. With this solution one can quickly find any term in such a relation using the initial conditions, which is very useful for series problems. The proof for this problem starts on page 10.
